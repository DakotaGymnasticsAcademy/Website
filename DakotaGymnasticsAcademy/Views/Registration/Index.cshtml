    <h4>CURIOUS ABOUT GYMNASTICS?</h4>

    <p>At Dakota Gymnastics Academy, we realize kids often want to try things out before committing. Unfortunately due to recent changes in the MGA insurance policy, we can no longer offer one-time drop-ins for individuals (a group rate is possible) just to try out a class. However, you can request to come in for an assessment if you're not sure which level your child is at. Assessments may be 15 minutes or longer depending on the child and their current skill level. Please contact us for assessment pricing.</p>
    <p>Maybe you just want to check it out? We would also love it if you stopped by with your child to see our facility, meet the coaches and watch a class!</p>

    <p>You can also come and visit us during our open house on June 8th, 2019 from 5pm to 7pm. Meet the coaches and try out the equipment!</p>
